Update OpenCore to 0.6.6
Remove BootProtect from plist, change LauncherOption to Full.
Resources updated using https://github.com/acidanthera/OcBinaryData

OpenCore 0.6.6 has a major change to the boot process: it is no longer a driver, but an application that you can boot directly (if curious, this has to do with Surface firmware failing to boot). Therefore, 0.6.6 removes BootProtect (also commonly known as Bootstrap) and replaces it with LauncherOption in its stead. It's not that different from Bootstrap; the difference is while Bootstrap added a boot entry for OpenCore's loader, as OpenCore doesn't need one anymore, LauncherOption will add a boot entry pointing directly to OpenCore.efi (unless you use a custom launcher with LauncherPath).

So why do you care? Well, this update to 0.6.6 will not automatically remove the old Bootstrap boot entry, so if you want to remove the old Bootstrap entry, dortania (ok fine it was basically me with some contributions from /u/dracoflar) has written a handy guide: Updating Bootstrap in 0.6.6

Oh and if you delete the Bootstrap folder as part of the update and you don't have any other entry to boot into OpenCore, you won't be able to get into OpenCore without bcfg in UEFI Shell/efibootmgr from Linux/copying OC's launcher to EFI/BOOT/BOOTx64.efi from another OS.
